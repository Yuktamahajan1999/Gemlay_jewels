# Gemlay Jewels UI – React + Tailwind CSS

Hi! I'm **Yukta Mahajan**, and this project is a React + Tailwind CSS implementation of the Gemlay Jewels Figma design.  
I recreated the UI from scratch, made it fully responsive, and focused on writing clean and reusable components that match the original design closely.

- Responsive design for desktop & mobile  
- Sections like categories, trending products, best sellers, testimonials, press, and banners  
- Login popup UI  
- Component-based structure using React + Tailwind
